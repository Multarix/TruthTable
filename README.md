# Truth Table
The script creates a truth table, technically works with upwards of hundreds of variables and very complex statements.<br>
Can also convert some of the dumb math jargon like "¬" meaning "not" or "∧" meaning "and" into javascript readable statements.<br>

Currently supported converisons:

> `¬` = `!`
> `∨` = `||`
> `∧` = `&&`
> `↔` = `===`;
